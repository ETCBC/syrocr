GETLINES

- splitting overlapping lines
  skipping (nearly) whole lines:
  * vts_psalms_088_2L
  * vts_psalms_090_2L
  example where it works well:
  * vts_psalms_095_1R
- getlines crashes (in drawing process) if no 'main' section
  e.g, when noise in margin creates a line without 'main'
- determining height baseline, with many final nun's or Sade's:
  e.g vts_kings083_2L line 8; vts_kings086_1R line 12
- of two dots above one character, only one is combined
  e.g. jeremiah page vts_3_2-003 line 6 character 35-36 id 127-128
